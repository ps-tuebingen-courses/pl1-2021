/**
Church Encoding
===============

Today we shrink our language. It does not seem to be big, but today we want to  illustrate how powerful our core language,
the lambda calculus, is. Here is a shrinked version of FAE that does not even have numbers anymore. For testing purposes,
we introduce a new expression ``PrintDot`` whose semantics is to print a dot on the screen.

Now we want to illustrate that we can, in principle, bootstrap a full programming language from this small core.
To do so, we use the technique of Church encoding. This means that each datum is represented by its own fold function.
