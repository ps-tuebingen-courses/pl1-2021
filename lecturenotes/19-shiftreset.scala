/**
Delimited Continuations
=======================
The continuations we have seen so far represent the whole call-stack. Invoking a continuation
was not like a function call because continuations never return a result. Invoking
a continuation is more similar to a disciplined version of GOTO.

However, the fact that continuations never return and represent the full call-stack often
makes their use cumbersome. In particular, such continuations cannot be composed. The
non-composability of continuations is visible in the fact that applications using 
first-class continuations often need to make use of mutable state.

This is different with _delimited continuations_. Delimited continuations only represent
a part of the call-stack, namely the part up to the next invocation of ``reset``. Delimited continuations
behave like functions, that is, they return a value and are hence composable.

Delimited continuations have many quite powerful applications, ranging from advanced exception handling
to backtracking algorithms and probabilistc programming as well as so-called algebraic effects.

Delimited continuations are available in Racket and many variants of Scheme, OCaML, Haskell and,
thanks to work in our research group, in Java.

Fortunately, a definitional interpreter for delimited continuations is pretty simple.
