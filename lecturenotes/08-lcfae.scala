Lazy Evaluation
===============

Motivation for Lazy Evaluation
------------------------------
read "Why Functional Programming Matters" by John Hughes available at http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html

What lazy evaluation means
--------------------------
The choice of evaluation strategy is a purely semantic change that requires no change to the syntax.
For this reason we reuse the syntactic definitions of FAE, hence ``:load 07-fae.scala`` before executing this script.

Before we discuss lazy evaluation, we will first discuss a related evaluation strategy, call-by-name.

Call-by-name can be explained very succintly in the substitution-based interpreter: Instead of evaluating the argument "a" in the
"App" case before substitution, we substitute the unevaluated argument into the body. The rest remains exactly the same.

def evalcbn(e: Exp) : Exp = e match {
  case Id(v) => sys.error("unbound identifier: " + v)
  case Add(l,r) => (evalcbn(l), evalcbn(r)) match {
                     case (Num(x),Num(y)) => Num(x+y)
                     case _ => sys.error("can only add numbers")
                    }
  case App(f,a) => evalcbn(f) match {
     case Fun(x,body) => evalcbn( subst(body,x, a)) // no evaluation of a!
     case _ => sys.error("can only apply functions")
  }
  case _ => e
}

/**
Does this change the semantics, or is it just an implementation detail? In other words, is ``eval(e) == evalcbn(e)`` for all ``e`` ?
Let's try two former test cases.
*/

assert( evalcbn(test) == eval(test))
assert(evalcbn(test2) == eval(test2))

/**
One can formally prove that if eval and evalcbn both produce a number then the numbers are equal. Do they also agree if they produce
a function?

Not necessarily. Consider:
*/

val test3 = App(Fun("f",Fun("x",App("f","x"))),Add(1,2))

assert(eval(test3) == Fun("x",App(Num(3),Id("x"))))
assert(evalcbn(test3) == Fun("x",App(Add(Num(1),Num(2)),Id("x"))))

/**
However, if both produce a function, then the functions "behave" the same. More specifically, the function bodies produced by evalcbn
may be  "more evaluated" than those produced by eval. If we would evaluate within function bodies (also called evaluation "under a lambda")
- which our interpreters do not do - we could produce the expression returned from eval from the expression returned by evalcbn.
This kind of equivalence is also called "beta-equivalence".

Most importantly, however, eval and evalcbn differ with regard to their termination behavior. We have seen that omega is a diverging
expression. In eval, the term

 val test4 = App(Fun("x",5),omega)

/**
 is hence also diverging. In contrast:
*/

assert(evalcbn(test4) == Num(5))

/**
Extra material: Infinite lists in FAE (not relevant for exam)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Using our call-by-name interpreter, we can express the same kinds of programming patterns that we have tried in Haskell, such as
infinite lists.

We do not have direct support for lists, but we can encode lists. This kind of encoding is called _Church encoding_.

For instance, we can map the successor function over the 1,2,3 list.

assert(eval(test5) == eval(test5res))
/**
Using evalcbn instead of eval the assertion does not hold (why?), but the results are beta-equivalent.

We can also construct infinite lists. To this end, we need some form of recursion. We choose the standard fixed-point operator Y.
This operator only works under call-by-name or other so-called "non-strict" evaluation strategies.
*/

val y = Fun("f", App(Fun("x",App("f", App("x","x"))), Fun("x",App("f",App("x","x")))))

/**
Using Y, we can construct infinite lists, such as the list of all natural numbers.

val allnats = App(App("y", Fun("nats", Fun("n", App(App("cons","n"), App("nats", Add("n",1)))))),1)

/**

val list2toinfty = wth("cons",cons,
                   wth("nil", nil,
                   wth("y", y,

                      App(App("maplist", Fun("x", Add("x",1))), allnats)))))
/**
Of course, ``list2toinfty`` diverges when we use ``eval``, but it works fine with ``evalcbn``. It is hard to verify the result due to
an almost unreadable output. Hence we propose the following

Exercise: Extend the language such that you can implement the "take" function as known from Haskell within the language
(if0-expressions or something like it are needed for that). Now add a "print" function that prints a number on the console.
Use it to display the first 3 list elements of test2toinfty are 2,3,4.

/**
Environment-based lazy evaluation
---------------------------------
Let us now consider the question how we can implement call-by-name in the environment-based interpreter. Translating the idea of not
evaluating the function argument to the environment-based version seems to  suggest that the environment should map identifiers to
expression instead of values.

However, we run into the same problems that we had with first-class functions before we introduced closures: What happens to the
deferred substitutions that still have to be applied in the function argument? If we discard the environment in which the function
argument was defined we again introduce a variant of dynamic scoping.

Hence, like for closures, we need to store the environment together with the expression. We call such a  pair a _thunk_. An environment
hence becomes a mapping from symbols to thunks. Note that environments and thunks are hence mutually recursive. In Scala, we can hence
not use type definitions of the form

   type Thunk = (Exp, Env)
   type Env = Map[String, Thunk]

Instead, we use a Scala class Env to express this recursion.

Since we want to experiment with different variants of how to generate and evaluate thunks we first create a parameterizable variant
of the evaluator that leaves open how to
  1. represent thunks (type Thunk)
  2. create thunks (method delay)
  3. evaluate thunks (method force).

Hint: Research on the internet what abstract type members in Scala are.  For instance, here: http://www.scala-lang.org/node/105

      def apply(key: String) = map.apply(key)
      def +(other: (String, Thunk)) : Env = Env(map+other)
    }

    def delay(e: Exp, env: Env) : Thunk
    def force(t: Thunk) : Value

    // since values also depend on Env and hence on Thunk they need to
    // be defined within this trait
    sealed abstract class Value
    case class NumV(n: Int) extends Value
    case class ClosureV(f: Fun, env: Env) extends Value
    def eval(e: Exp, env: Env) : Value = e match {
      case Id(x) => force(env(x)) // force evaluation of thunk if identifier is evaluated
      case Add(l,r) => {
        (eval(l,env), eval(r,env)) match {
          case (NumV(v1),NumV(v2)) => NumV(v1+v2)

/**

called _call-by-need_.

Caching is easy to implement in Scala:

      t.cache
    } else println ("Reusing cached value "+t.cache+" for expression "+t.e)
    t.cache
  }
}

/**
For instance, compare call-by-need and call-by-name in cbntest or blowup.

However, the meta-language (i.e., the subset of Scala features) used in the interpreter has become more complicated:
Since we are using mutation, the order of evaluation and aliasing of object references becomes important.
Luckily,  call-by-need agrees with call-by-name with regard to produced values and termination behavior, hence it is usually not
necessary to reason about programs with the call-by-need semantics. If, however, one wants to reason about the performance of a
program in a call-by-need setting, one has to take these additional complications into account. In practice, it is even worse,
since languages like Haskell perform additional optimizations that, for instance, switch to call-by-value if an analysis can
determine that an argument will definitely be used (lookup "strictness analysis").

Topics for class discussion:
 - Is it a good idea to mix a language with implicit mutation (such as Java, Scala, C++, Python, ...) with lazy evaluation?
 - How can one simulate lazy evaluation in an eager language? Basic idea: 'Lambda' as evaluation firewall.
