## Task 1: Garbage Collection

Review the lecture notes on [Garbage](https://github.com/ps-tuebingen-courses/pl1-2021/blob/master/lecturenotes/10-bcfae.scala) [Collection](https://github.com/ps-tuebingen-courses/pl1-2021/blob/master/lecturenotes/11-gc.scala)
and answer the following questions:

1. What was the reason why garbage collectors were invented in the first place?
2. What does it mean for a garbage collector to be _safe_?
3. What is a _generational_ garbage collection algorithm and why is it useful?
4. What is _reference counting_ and what is its disadvantage?

## Task 2: Compositional interpreter

As suggested by the [lecture notes](https://github.com/ps-tuebingen-courses/pl1-2021/blob/master/lecturenotes/12-syntacticvsmeta.scala#L68), reimplement the Compositional interpreter as an internal visitor.
