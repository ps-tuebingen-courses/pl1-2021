## Task 1

Transform the expression `f(f(3) + f(4))` into CPS.

Hint: The resulting expression starts with `k => ...`.
As in the lecture, you can use a subscript k to refer to the name of a CPS-transformed function, e.g., `f_k` for the CPS version of `f`.

## Task 2

Transform the following programs into CPS:

```scala
def all(f: Int => Boolean, list: List[Int]): Boolean =
  if (list.isEmpty) {
    true
  } else {
    f(list.head) && all(f, list.tail)
  }

val even = (number: Int) => number % 2 == 0

assert(all(even, List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)))
assert(!(all(even, List(2, 4, 7, 8, 10))))
```

Hint: The signature of the transformed `all` is:
```scala
all_k[T](f_k: (Int, Boolean => T) => T, list: List[Int], k: Boolean => T): T
```
Here the generic type `T` is used such that `all_k` may be called with arbitrary continuations `k`, as long as they take a `Boolean` as input.
Of course, you have to make sure that your code typechecks, which especially means it adheres to the type signature of `all_k`.
