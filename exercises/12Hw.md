# Homework 12

**Deadline: Friday, July 23, 12:00**

This is the final homework.

## Task 1: Let-polymorphism

Learning goal: understand concretely the additional expressivity from
let-polymorphism over STLC.

In the following expression, can you replace `???` by a type annotation that
makes it typecheck in STLC?

```scala
val exTypeInferenceSTLC =
  Let("f", Fun("x", ???, "x"),
    Let("dummy", App('f, 1),
      App("f", Fun('y, NumType(), "y"))))
```

What about the Hindley-Milner version?

```scala
val exTypeInferenceHM =
  Let("f", Fun("x", "x"),
    Let("dummy", App("f", 1),
      App("f", Fun("y", "y"))))
```

## Task 2: Hindley-Milner type inference

Perform type inference on the following programs in Hindley-Milner.

Note: I don't include Scala versions of these programs because Scala does not use
Hindley-Milner type inference (since it is tricky to combine with Scala's
object-oriented features).

```scala
val e1 = Fun("x", "x")
val e2 = Fun("x", Add("x", 1))

//This term is in an open context.
val e3: Exp = Add("x", 1)
val e3Ctx = Map("x" -> freshTypeVar)

val apply: Exp = Fun("f", Fun("x", App("f", "x")))
val compose: Exp = Fun("f", Fun("g", Fun("x", App("g", App("f", "x")))))
```
