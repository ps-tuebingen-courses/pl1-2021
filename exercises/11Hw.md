# Homework 11

## Task 1: Lambda-lifting and defunctionalization

Following examples in the lecture, apply lambda-lifting and defunctionalization
to the following code samples (in increasing order of difficulty).

1. 
```scala
def map(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(xs)(f)
}

def caller1(l: List[Int]) =
  map(l)(x => x + 1) ++
    map(List(1, 2, 3))(x => x + 2)
```

2.
```scala
def map(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(xs)(f)
}

def flatMap(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) ++ flatMap(xs)(f)
}

def caller3(l: List[Int]) =
  flatMap(List(1, 2, 3))(x =>
    map(List(x + 1))(y =>
      x + y))
```

3. (Hint: Note that there is also a first-class function in `map2`, not just in `caller4`.)
```scala
def flatMap(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) ++ flatMap(xs)(f)
}

def map2(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = flatMap(xs) {
  x => List(f(x))
}

def caller4(l: List[Int]) =
  flatMap(List(1, 2, 3))(x =>
    map2(List(x * 3))(y =>
      x + y + 42))
```

## Task 2: STLC

1. Typecheck by hand the STLC expressions in the following subtasks (in the
   empty context, unless otherwise specified). For each expression, you only
   need to write whether it is type-correct and which is its overall type.
2. Try to predict whether the corresponding Scala versions (copied below) are
   going to typecheck, based on the typechecking behavior of the STLC version.
3. You can check your answers using the actual typecheckers, but only after
   you've done the task by hand.

### Subtask 2.1

This expression is in a non-empty context.

```scala
//Typecheck
val plusOneOpen: Exp = Add("x", 1)
//In the following context:
val plusOneGamma: Map[String, Type] = Map("x" -> NumType())
//val plusOneScala = x + 1
```

### Subtask 2.2

These expressions are in empty contexts and focus on the core of STLC.

For `e2`, we make use of a type `boolT`, which can be either added as primitive like `NumType()`
or defined as `SumType(JunitType(), JunitType())`.

```scala
val e1: Exp = Fun("x", NumType(), "x")
//val e1Scala = (x: Int) => x
val e2: Exp = Fun("x", boolT, "x")
//val e2Scala = (x: Boolean) => x
val e3: Exp = Fun("x", FunType(NumType(), NumType()), "x")
//val e3Scala = (x: (Int => Int)) => x
val funPlusOne: Exp = Fun("x", FunType(NumType(), NumType()), Add("x", 1))
//val funPlusOneScala = (x: (Int => Int)) => x + 1
```
